## Learn CSS Display & Position: Interactive Playground

Welcome to the Learn CSS Display & Position Interactive Playground\! This website is designed to help you master the fundamental concepts of CSS `display` and `position` properties through engaging, hands-on interaction.

---

### About

Understanding how elements are rendered and positioned on a webpage is crucial for any web developer. This playground provides a dynamic environment where you can experiment with various `display` values (like `flex`, `grid`, `block`, `inline-block`) and `position` values (like `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`) and instantly see their effects.

Forget static explanations\! Here, you'll find:

-  **Interactive Toggles:** Switch between different `display` and `position` values with simple toggles and observe the immediate visual changes.
-  **Playable Examples:** Manipulate elements directly on the screen to grasp complex concepts like Flexbox alignment, Grid layouts, and the stacking context of `z-index`.
-  **Clear Information:** Concise explanations accompany each interactive example, reinforcing your understanding.
-  **Real-time Feedback:** See how changes to properties affect the layout in real-time, building a strong intuition for CSS behavior.

Whether you're a beginner just starting with CSS or an experienced developer looking to solidify your understanding of these core concepts, this playground offers an intuitive and effective learning experience.
